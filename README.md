# Improved FRST Log Cleaner

## Enhancements:

* Added automatic detection for `FRST.txt` and `Addition.txt` in these directories (Desktop, Documents, Downloads) based on the user's OS.
* No need to manually input file paths, simply type "clean" to start the process.
* Ensured compatibility with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
* Convenient for help providers using a different OS than the infected patient.

## How to use:

* Run the script and type "clean" (case insensitive). Bread will do the rest for you. (เน>ุโขฬเน)>๐
